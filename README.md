This project focuses on forecasting the prices of gold futures using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. While the model performs well, I’m looking for suggestions to improve its efficiency and accuracy.

If you have any recommendations for:
	•	Hyperparameter tuning
	•	Feature engineering
	•	Techniques to speed up training or improve convergence

Feel free to share your insights!
